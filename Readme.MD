## Interactive Web App with Streamlit and Scikit-learn

This is a simple Streamlit project that demonstrates the accuracy of multiple classification models on a dataset. The purpose of this project is to showcase the ability to build a basic user interface that allows users to interact with the models and see the results in real-time.

The dataset used in this project contains multiple classes, and the models that are evaluated include Logistic Regression, KNN , Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machines. The user can select the model of their choice and see the accuracy of that model on the dataset.
